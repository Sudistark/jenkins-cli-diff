getNumber=\ Gets the executor number that uniquely identifies it among\n other {@link Executor}s for the same computer.\n\n @return\n      a sequential number starting from 0.\n
isIdle=\ Returns true if this {@link Executor} is ready for action.\n
isLikelyStuck=\ Returns true if the current build is likely stuck.\n\n <p>\n This is a heuristics based approach, but if the build is suspiciously taking for a long time,\n this method returns true.\n
getCurrentExecutableForApi=\ Same as {@link \#getCurrentExecutable} but checks {@link Item\#READ}.\n
getProgress=\ Returns the progress of the current build in the number between 0-100.\n\n @return -1\n      if it's impossible to estimate the progress.\n
